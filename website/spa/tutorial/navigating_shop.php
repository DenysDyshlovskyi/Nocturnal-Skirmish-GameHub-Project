    <h1>Navigating the shop</h1>
    <p>
        The shop is a place where you can buy borders, characters, cards and open crates.
        The shop can be accessed by going on the main hub and clicking the <b>"Shop"</b> button.
    </p>
    <div>

    <p>
        The shop is still a work in progress, so for now, none of the functions described over works.
