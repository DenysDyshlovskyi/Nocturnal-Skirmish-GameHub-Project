    <h1>Choosing your settings</h1>
    <p>
        There are also other settings you can customize, including your border and audio settings.
        Lets start with changing your border. To change your border, you click the <b>"Change border"</b> tab,
        and click on the border you want to change to. You can only change to borders you have unlocked.

        You can purchase borders in the shop using runes that you collect by playing. If you have further questions on this topic, visit the FaQ.
